# The Dandelion Project - Amphisbaena

Weekend project implementing 'some kind of' on-lattice Triplet-Triplet Annihiliation Upconversion. Plan is to compare upper efficiency limits for solution based vs. in polymer film vs. in copolymer.

Amphisbaena is coming back, and she's going to be rocking dandelion heads to
inter systems cross at either end, and her 1D diffusion of excitons will be
up-converting faster than you can say Shockley-Queisser.

OK; had a quick look at the ASCII lattice form for Amphisbaena<>gorgophone.
Polymer chains are identified by ID, and empty space is -1. This obviously
means we can extend into negative numbers to label the dandelion head ISC
chromophores. I'm going to start with -2 for both heads, though we could use
-ve snake ID.
