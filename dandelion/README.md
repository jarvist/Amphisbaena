# The Dandelion Project - Amphisbaena

Weekend project implementing 'some kind of' on-lattice Triplet-Triplet Annihiliation Upconversion. Plan is to compare upper efficiency limits for solution based vs. in polymer film vs. in copolymer.

Amphisbaena is coming back, and she's going to be rocking dandelion heads to
inter systems cross at either end, and her 1D diffusion of excitons will be
up-converting faster than you can say Shockley-Queisser.
